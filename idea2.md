This idea is a simple game. The design / illustration of the game is set-up like Pac-man. 
Black background and white lines for the maze. 
The ball that the user controls would bright yellow/neon so it is clear for the users to see with more contrast. 
Then the mission is to move the ball, which is connected by the userâ€™s mouse, 
across the field without touching the lines of the maze. This game is a success or fail outcome. 
Every time the user touches the side, there will an alarm sound effect and a restart to the game once the user fails.
