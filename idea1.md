This idea is called, “My Plant.” It is a graphical idea of growing a plant.
There is a new leaf sprouting from the soil in a pot. 
It is an interaction of the user to use the mouse to move the waterer, which follows wherever the mouse goes, 
and when the user ‘clicks,’ it will tilt and pour the water into the plant. 
Every time the user waters the plant, the sprout will grow and grow until a flower blooms. 
There will be a watering sound effect to make the user experience to be more realistic in growing a plant. 
The design of this project will in a light green background, purple pot, and brown for soil.
